// Since our named routes are noting but string literals hence we store this to this file as constant so that we can use them across the app rather hardcoding it in the main.dart file.

// const loginRoute = '/login/';
// const registerRoute = '/register/';
// const notesRoute = '/notes/';
// const verifyEmailRoute = '/verify-email/';
const createOrUpdateNoteRoute = 'notes/new-note/';
